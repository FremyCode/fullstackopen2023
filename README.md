### This repository is for my progress during the Fullstack Open 2023 course.

#### Do note that I have taken the liberty to use TypeScript and NextJS instead of Vite. I may not be following the course to the letter as I will try to complete the exercises to my best ability.

The exercises will be broken into separate branches which will be named after the part and related exercises.

##### If you would like to run this project:

1. Pull the repository.
2. Use "npm install" to install all the dependencies.
3. Use "npm run dev" to run the project.
4. Open up your browser to "localhost:3000".

You can browse through different completed exercises by switching the branch in the repository.
